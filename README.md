Roy G. Biv is a small client-side image manipulation app. It uses the HTML5 File API, prompting you to select an image, reading the contents of the file you select, and then loading the image into the canvas. From there it manipulates the canvas image by accessing pixel values and using the toDataURL method. The app borrows heavily from Rob Hawkesâ€™ book Foundation HTML5 Canvas and the MDN article on File API.
